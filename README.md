# **SBT-Based Loyalty and Governance System**

## **Overview**
This repository contains the design, documentation, and implementation plan for a **Soulbound Token (SBT) Loyalty and Governance System** designed for the **SingularityNET Ambassador Program**. The system incentivizes active participation by tracking contributions through non-transferable tokens (SBTs), badges, and reputation scores.

## **Project Deliverables**

### 1. **Project Timeline and Milestones**
- This project is divided into multiple phases, with each phase representing a key step in the development process.
  - **Phase 1: Prototype Development** (Dates)
    - Initial development of SBT framework and contribution tracking.
  - **Phase 2: Beta Testing** (Dates)
    - Testing with a limited number of workgroups and guilds (3 guilds and 3 workgroups).
  - **Phase 3: Full Deployment** (Dates)
    - Expansion of the system to all guilds and workgroups.
  - **Phase 4: Final Product with Early Access** (Dates)
    - Early access testing for bugs and feature refinement before the full launch.

For detailed milestones, refer to the [Project Milestones](./docs/milestones.md).

### 2. **Documentation and User Guides**
- **System Documentation**:
  - The complete design document outlining the architecture and functionality of the system can be found [here](./docs/SBT_System_Design.md).
- **User Guides**:
  - A step-by-step user guide for contributors, covering how to earn and redeem coupons, mint badges, and participate in governance, is available [here](./docs/user_guide.md).

### 3. **Objective Definition Workshops**
- Regular workshops will be held to define the objectives of the system, ensuring alignment with the goals of the SingularityNET Ambassador Program.
  - **Workshop 1**: Objectives for Phase 1 (Prototype Development) - [Workshop Summary](./docs/workshops/objective_definition_1.md)
  - **Workshop 2**: Feedback from Beta Testers - [Workshop Summary](./docs/workshops/objective_definition_2.md)

### 4. **Platform/DApp Wireframe Design**
- A wireframe of the platform/DApp is provided to visualize the system's user interface and core functionalities.
  - **Wireframe Overview**: [Link to Wireframes](./design/wireframe.md)

### 5. **Soulbound Tokens (SBT) Structure**
- The SBT structure is defined to track contributions across workgroups and guilds using **Coupons**, **Badges**, and **Reputation**.
  - **SBT Structure Overview**: [SBT Documentation](./docs/SBT_structure.md)
  - **Coupons and Badges**: Detailed explanation of how they work within the system can be found [here](./docs/coupons_badges.md).

### 6. **System Architecture Design Document**
- The complete architecture of the system, including smart contracts, data flow, and reputation algorithm, is outlined in the detailed design document.
  - **System Architecture Document**: [System Architecture](./docs/system_architecture.md)
